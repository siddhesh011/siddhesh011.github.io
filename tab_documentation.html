		<h2 style="color: steelblue;">Introduction </h2>
		<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a public health survey conducted every year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States. It is one of the largest telephonic surveys which collects data on health-related behaviors, chronic condition, and preventive health practices among adults. It contains information on factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet, and mental health. It also includes data on demographic characteristics such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and income. The data is a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers and public health officials interested in studying and addressing various health issues in the US population. 

The idea behind working on this data is to find out the percentage of people affected by poor health behavior. As this is a recent survey data, we focused on different health-related trends. Also, we assume that our analysis will help people take some preventive measures in order to avoid future health issues as well as the new generation from affecting from different health-related risk factors. </p>

 <h2 style="color: steelblue;">Findings From Analysis</h2>

         	<p>The timeline graph presented herein has been generated by applying filters such as class, topic, question, and response. The graph exhibits a visual representation of the trend of alcohol consumption over a period of time, with the x-axis depicting years and the y-axis showing sample size. The data analysis indicates that the overall trend of alcohol consumption has decreased consistently over the entire timeline. Notably, the highest percentage of alcohol consumption was observed in the year 2011, while the lowest percentage was recorded in 2020, which could be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative to acknowledge that the observed trend suggests that individuals have been making more informed decisions regarding their alcohol consumption, leading to a decline in its usage.</p>

		<p>Based on the presented bar graph, it can be observed that the age group ranging from 25-34 years old has the highest percentage of alcohol consumption, followed by the other age groups. Interestingly, the 65+ and 18-24 age groups have a similar percentage of drinking habits, both around 11.5 percent.

In addition, the map demonstrates the distribution of alcohol consumption, with Nebraska appearing to be the highest consumer of alcohol, while Nevada has one of the lowest rates. Such insights into alcohol consumption patterns can be valuable for informing public health policies and interventions.</p>

The presented heat map illustrates the consumption of tobacco products over a span of several years. The map provides a comprehensive overview of the percentage of tobacco usage on a yearly basis. Notably, the data analysis reveals that the year 2011 witnessed the highest percentage of tobacco consumption. Furthermore, the risk factor assessment of tobacco usage by state indicates significant variation, with some states exhibiting higher levels of tobacco consumption than others. Specifically, Nevada was found to have the lowest usage of tobacco products, while Kansas and Nebraska were observed to have the highest usage compared to other states in the USA. These findings shed light on the alarming prevalence of tobacco usage and its potential health implications, emphasizing the need for effective public health interventions to mitigate this issue.</p>

		<p>The following distribution chart depicts the prevalence of overweight and obesity based on Body Mass Index (BMI), categorized by gender, age group, and race. Our analysis reveals that females have a higher percentage of obesity than males. Furthermore, as we examine the data based on age groups, we found that individuals aged 65 and above are more likely to be overweight and may require additional assistance to address their health concerns. In contrast, individuals in their younger ages are observed to have lower levels of obesity. Additionally, when we investigate the data based on race, we found that individuals from the White (non-Hispanic) race had the highest percentage of high BMI. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and public health initiatives to address the issue of obesity and associated health complications.</p>
